//Rough guideline of the logic and control flow

1. Loop through the array until you find a value greater than k.

2. The minute you find a value greater than k, check if each value in nums greater than k is equal to the first value greater than k.
	2.1. If there exists a value not equal to the first value greater than k then k is not valid.
             2.1.1. Save the index of every value equal to the first number greater than k

        2.2. If all values greater than k are equal to the first value greater than k, then change all of their values to k.
